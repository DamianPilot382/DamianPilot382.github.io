This house, new in 1908, was a wedding gift to the bride and groom when built.  This was also the home to the 1st USC Olympiad, Emil Breitkreutz.  Over 3 generations the house was loved until it was sold in 1999, to a San Marino native and his family, who did a tasteful addition, restored it, and upgraded the wiring, landscaping and plumbing.
