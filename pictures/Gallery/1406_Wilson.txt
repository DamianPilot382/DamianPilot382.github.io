This was a lovely home that a developer purchased and then quickly abandoned maintenance, thus calling it a “tear down”.  City allowed demolition despite the owner’s dishonesty and disrespect for ordinances regarding exposed plywood, wall a/c units, etc.  Neighbors fought “new construction” and their nomination for its historic recognition was denied.  Developer claimed to need over 3,000 sq. feet of basement for “nieces and nephews’ toys,” yet it was later discovered that owner was actually a developer incorporating designer basements with marble floors, crown molding and 10 ft. ceilings.
