San Marino Heritage founder Shirley Jagels makes a claim for historic preservation at tear down site and somehow remains composed during the reckless demolition.  As a neighbor, she later witnessed demo contractor "staff" urinating behind a shabbily-protected tree because "cheapest way" developer failed to provide a Porta-Potty.  Upon calling SMPD regarding public decency this concerned, neighbor was told to notify Cal OSHA.
