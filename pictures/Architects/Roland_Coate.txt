Roland Coate, Sr., was born in Richmond, IN on 12/05/1890. In 1930, he and his family resided at 389 California Terrace in Pasadena, CA, a residence that had an estimated value of $21,000. The architect, Robert D. Farquhar (1872-1967) lived next door at 381 California Terrace. The census recorded that Coate maintained one servant in 1930, Willma L. Miller (born c. 1900 in KS). The Coate Family lived in Pasadena through 1935, at least, before moving to 1255 Oak Grove Avenue in San Marino, CA. This house had an estimated value of $30,000, much higher than the national average, but consistent with others nearby in the San Marino neighborhood. They maintained a housekeeper, Emma Cherry (born c. 1889 in NB), in 1940. In 1943, the Pasadena City Directory (p. 137) listed Roland Coate as a "Draftsman," living at 1255 Shenandoah Road in San Marino. (The 1947 City Directory stated that his residence was at 1258 Shenandoah. [p. 169].) Coate, Sr., died in San Diego County, CA, at the age of 67.
