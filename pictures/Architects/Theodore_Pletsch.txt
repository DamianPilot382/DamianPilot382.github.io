Credited for building what is today known as San Marino, Pletsch built hundreds of homes in various architectural styles all over, including Pasadena, San Marino (specifically on Lombardy, Rosalind, Orlando, Virginia, and Oak Grove), and other prestigious locations.But more than that, he built over 1,300 buildings in total, mostly in the San Gabriel Valley. He designed homes, storefronts, office buildings, the San Marino Tribune building, and a mausoleum in Brea.According to Pletsch, ”I only design what the customer wants. I’m no Frank Lloyd Wright–never wanted to be. It’s been so much fun I’ve never worked a day in my life. I’ve never been sued, and now one in six architects is sued every year.”
